This is the repository for part of my programs, that I've been writing on my programming course on "faculty of mathematics".

polynomial.py is a polynomial class in which there are a lot of methods for working with polynomials.

day_of_week.py is simply a prodramm that shows, which day of the week this date is.

Это все, что осталось от тех программ, которые я писал во время курса.
